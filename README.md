# JS-Loops-Iterators
## First to make the code clean I used a website called codebeautifu.org. Then I took that code and did the same as from the previous project and named the object student.
## Now I can find specific properties from my object: students.
### Total number of children: start the loop from 0 so i=0 then I want my loop to end at the sudent.length. and then I want to add all of the students children together so I put i++.
### To get only the name and age from the arrays I used the same concept as before except now in my console.log I only wanted the name and age. To get only the age and not the whole birthdate I had to do some math where the year minus the students fullYear equals their current age.
### here I found all of the properties in the array and displayed it in oder. To make a break between them so it easier to read I out " " before and after.
